# Cache poc
Experimenting with Spring Boot caching and Redis as Cache DB.

## Structure
The [Customer](src/main/java/com/wixia/rediscache/persistence/CustomerEo.java)
and [Item](src/main/java/com/wixia/rediscache/persistence/ItemEo.java)
are domain objects, in this case represented by JPA-data.
A customer has a relation to a list of items. A H2 instance is set up and
populated with a few example objects. The Customer has a overridden
repository, which can simulate delays dynamically.

## Access reactive service
```bash
curl localhost:8080/reactive/customers
```

## Delete data in redis
```bash
 for key in $(redis-cli keys '*'); do redis-cli DEL $key; done
 ```
